## Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a developer. The site is designed to provide a comprehensive view of my work, including my technical expertise, completed projects, and professional background. It's a one-stop platform where potential employers, collaborators, and anyone interested can learn more about me and my work.

- Skills: A detailed overview of the programming languages, tools, and frameworks I'm proficient in.
- Projects: A showcase of the projects I've worked on, including descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or source code.
- Contact: A contact form for visitors to get in touch with me directly through the site.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity and handling application logic.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
